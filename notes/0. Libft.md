## memset 🚳
- Doesn't control if it surpases *s == '\0'
- Returns *s
## bzero🚳
The **bzero**() function erases the data in the _n_ bytes of the memory
       starting at the location pointed to by _s_, by writing zeros (bytes
       containing '\0') to that area.
## memcpy🚳
- Control src == dest, n == 0
The **memcpy**() function copies _n_ bytes from memory area _src_ to
       memory area _dest_.  The memory areas must not overlap.  Use
       [memmove(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memmove.3.html) if the memory areas do overlap.
The **memcpy**() function returns a pointer to _dest_.
## memmove 🚳
- Temporary array: dest and src may overlap, so save src in temp and temp to dest.
## memchr 🚳
- scans the initial _n_ bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ for the first instance of _c_.  Both _c_ and the bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ are interpreted as _unsigned char_.
- return a pointer to the matching byte or NULL if the character does not occur in the given memory area.
- intentar reducir n
## memcmp 🚳
- compares the first _n_ bytes (each interpreted as _unsigned char_) of the memory areas _s1_ and _s2_.
- returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first _n_ bytes of _s1_ is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first _n_ bytes of _s2_. For a nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair of bytes (interpreted as _unsigned char_) that differ in _s1_ and _s2_. If _n_ is zero, the return value is zero.
- por que no para cuando s1 o s2 ya acaban?
- por que usar punteros?

## strchr 🚳
- The **strchr**() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character _c_ in the string _s_
- return a pointer to the matched character or NULL if the character is not found.  The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if _c_ is specified as '\0', these functions return a pointer to the terminator.
## strrchr 🚳
 - The **strrchr**() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character _c_ in the string _s_.
 - return a pointer to the matched character or NULL if the character is not found. The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if _c_ is specified as '\0', these functions return a pointer to the terminator.
 - posible necesidad de casting.
## strncmp 🚳
- no se si hay que castear
## strlcpy 🚳
## strlcat 🚳
## strnstr 🚳
- The **strnstr**() function locates the first occurrence of the  null-terminated  string _little_ in the string _big_, where not more than _len_ characters are searched.  Characters that appear after a '\0' character  are not  searched.  
- If _little_ is an empty string, _big_ is returned; if _little_ occurs nowhere in _big_, NULL is returned; otherwise a pointer to the first character of the first occurrence of little is returned.
- Cuidado con limitar la busqueda dentro de len > i+j, que no se acabe big ni little. No devolver la primera ocurrencia en el segundo bucle

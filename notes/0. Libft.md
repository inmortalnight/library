# Funciones
## memset 🚳
- Doesn't control if it surpases *s == '\0'
- Returns *s
## bzero🚳
The **bzero**() function erases the data in the _n_ bytes of the memory
       starting at the location pointed to by _s_, by writing zeros (bytes
       containing '\0') to that area.
## memcpy🚳
- Control src == dest, n == 0
The **memcpy**() function copies _n_ bytes from memory area _src_ to
       memory area _dest_.  The memory areas must not overlap.  Use
       [memmove(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memmove.3.html) if the memory areas do overlap.
The **memcpy**() function returns a pointer to _dest_.
## memmove 🚳👍
- Temporary array: dest and src may overlap, so save src in temp and temp to dest.
## memchr 🚳
- scans the initial _n_ bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ for the first instance of _c_.  Both _c_ and the bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ are interpreted as _unsigned char_.
- return a pointer to the matching byte or NULL if the character does not occur in the given memory area.
- intentar reducir n
## memcmp 🚳
- compares the first _n_ bytes (each interpreted as _unsigned char_) of the memory areas _s1_ and _s2_.
- returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first _n_ bytes of _s1_ is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first _n_ bytes of _s2_. For a nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair of bytes (interpreted as _unsigned char_) that differ in _s1_ and _s2_. If _n_ is zero, the return value is zero.
- por que no para cuando s1 o s2 ya acaban?
- por que usar punteros?
## strlen🚳 
## isalpha 👍
## isdigit 👍
## isalnum 👍
## isascii 👍 
ASCII (códigos 0–127), al 255 son otros signos.
## isprint 👍
**Rango válido:** códigos ASCII 32 (espacio) a 126 (`~`).
## toupper 👍 
## tolower 👍
## strchr 🚳
- The **strchr**() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character _c_ in the string _s_
- return a pointer to the matched character or NULL if the character is not found.  The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if _c_ is specified as '\0', these functions return a pointer to the terminator.
## strrchr 🚳
 - The **strrchr**() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character _c_ in the string _s_.
 - return a pointer to the matched character or NULL if the character is not found. The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if _c_ is specified as '\0', these functions return a pointer to the terminator.
 - posible necesidad de casting.
## strncmp 🚳
- no se si hay que castear
## strlcpy 🚳
- copy strings src in dest
- take the full size of the buffer (not just the length) ??
- NUL-terminate the result as long as size is larger than 0 or, 
- Note that a byte for the NUL should be included in size.  
- only operate on true “C” trings.  This means that for strlcpy() src must be NUL-terminated 
- The strlcpy() function copies up to size - 1 characters from the NUL-terminated string src to dst, NUL-terminating the result.

- return the total length of the string they tried to create.  
- For strlcpy() that means the length of src.
## strlcat 🚳
- concatenate strings, copy src at final of dest
- take the full size of the buffer (not just the length) 
- NUL-terminate the result as long as there is at least one byte free in dst.  
- Note that a byte for the NUL should be included in size.  
- only operate on true “C” trings. strlcat() both src and dst must be NUL-terminated.
- strlcat() function appends the NUL-terminated string src to the end of dst.  It will append at most size - strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NUL-terminating the result.

- return the total length of the string they tried to create.  
- For strlcat() that means the initial length of dst plus the length of src.  While this may seem somewhat confusing, it was done to make truncation detection simple.
- if strlcat() traverses size characters without finding a NUL, the length of the string is considered to be size and the destination string will not be NUL-terminated (since there was no space for the NUL).  This keeps strlcat() from running off the end of a string.  In practice this should not happen (as it means that either size is incorrect or that dst is not a proper “C” string).  The check exists to prevent potential security problems in incorrect code.
## strnstr 🚳
- The **strnstr**() function locates the first occurrence of the  null-terminated  string _little_ in the string _big_, where not more than _len_ characters are searched.  Characters that appear after a '\0' character  are not  searched.  
- If _little_ is an empty string, _big_ is returned; if _little_ occurs nowhere in _big_, NULL is returned; otherwise a pointer to the first character of the first occurrence of little is returned.
- Cuidado con limitar la busqueda dentro de len > i+j, que no se acabe big ni little. No devolver la primera ocurrencia en el segundo bucle 
## atoi 🚳
## calloc (malloc) 🚳
- The calloc() function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.  The memory is set to zero.  
- If nmemb or size is 0,  then  calloc() returns a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free().  
- ?? If the multiplication of nmemb and size would result in  integer  overflow, then calloc() returns an error.  By contrast, an integer overflow would not be detected in the following call to malloc(),  with the result that an incorrectly sized block of memory would be allocated:  malloc(nmemb * size);
- lo del 0
## strdup (malloc) 🚳
- returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string s. Memory for the new string  is obtained  with malloc(3), and can be freed with free(3).
- returns a pointer to the duplicated string.  It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available, with errno set to indicate the cause of the error
